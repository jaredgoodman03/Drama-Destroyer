	Need a TOLO date, but don't want to deal with spreadsheets and awkwardness, and you know, actually
	having to talk to people? Oh boy oh boy, do I have a solution for you. The Drama Destroyer uses
	a powerful and complicated AI to match people based on their rankings. Simply enter the list of
	people you'd be willing to go to TOLO with, and the Drama Destroyer outputs all the couples for
	the dance. It keeps the people on your list who don't like you back a secret, so you don't need to
	ever face rejection.<br><br>
